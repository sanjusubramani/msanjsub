 Various nonlinear, fixed-neighbourhood techniques based on local statistics have been proposed in the literature for filtering noise in colour images. 
 We present adaptive vector filtering (AVF) techniques for noise removal in colour images. 
 The main idea is to find for each pixel (called the “seed” when being processed) a variable-shaped, variable-sized neighbourhood that contains only pixels that are similar to the seed.
 Then, statistics computed within the adaptive neighbourhood are used to derive the filter output. 
 Results of the AVF techniques are compared with those given by a few multivariate fixed-neighbourhood filters: 
 the double-window modified trimmed-mean filter, the generalized vector directional filter – double-window – α-trimmed mean filter, 
 the adaptive hybrid multivariate filter, and the adaptive nonparametric filter with Gaussian kernel. 
 It is shown that the AVF techniques provide better visual results, effectively suppressing noise while not blurring edges; 
 the results are also better in terms of objective measures (such as normalized mean-squared error and normalized colour difference) than the results of the other methods.
